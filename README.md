# Special Topics in Computer Networks

Term: Spring 2016, NTNU-CSIE

Instructor: Ling-Jyh Chen (Academia Sinica; cclljj@gmail.com)

Time: Tuesday 2-5pm

Location: NTNU Lib 801

## Course Description

This is a project-printed course with focuses on IoT, smart city, and participatory urban sensing related issues. During the lectures, we will introduce the maker movement, IoT technology, and the concept of participatory urban sensing. There will be plenty of hand-on activities in the class, and this grading of this course will be based on the projects.

It is recommended (but not a must) that students bring their own laptops to the class activities, and it is expected that students carry out their own projects at the end of his course. All the IoT platforms and sensors will be prepared by the lecturer and distributed in the course. Basic programming and quick self-learning (by reading Internet documents) skills are required for taking this course.
